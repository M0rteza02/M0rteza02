## 👋 Hi, I’m Morteza – Computer Engineering Graduate

---

## 🌟 About Me
I recently graduated from **Linköping University** with a **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering**, and I’m especially curious about how technology shapes the world of finance.  
Over the past few years, I’ve discovered that I really enjoy combining my technical skills with my interest in financial systems, whether it’s building reliable backends, working with data, or exploring how algorithms and software can improve decision-making.  

I enjoy working in teams where people share ideas openly, and I learn a lot from tackling complex problems together. My mindset is curious and persistent, and I like to break big challenges into smaller parts and work through them carefully.

## 💡 Mindset & Soft Skills
- 🔍 **Curiosity** – Always motivated to explore and learn new tools and technologies that help me build solutions that are more  efficient and scalable, especially in areas like data-driven systems where reliability truly matters.
- 🤝 **Teamwork** – I’ve worked in settings where collaboration is key, from pair programming to team sprints, but I also enjoy taking initiative and driving tasks forward on my own when needed.
- 🚀 **Growth mindset** – I see challenges as chances to learn and improve. I also enjoy discussing my solutions with others to get new perspectives and make the final result even stronger.
