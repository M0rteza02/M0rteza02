## 👋 Hi, I’m Morteza – Computer Engineering Graduate

## 🌟 About Me
I recently graduated from **Linköping University** with a **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering**.

I enjoy working in teams where people share ideas openly, and I learn a lot from solving problems collaboratively. My mindset is curious and persistent, and I like to break big problems into smaller parts and work through them carefully.
